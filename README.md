Second Year students at State Tech continue their Database education with another Web focused class where we learn how to use PHP.

## Overview
The official title of this class is advanced Database Sys Management, but a large majority of what we leanrned was how to utilize PHP in our web applications.

## Assignments

We just made a simple page that performed a math operation with two random numbers and pulls up an image based up the result of that operation.

### assocArray

In this assignment, we learned how to build an associative array, and then looped through and display the contents of the array.

### string-manip
_______
For the string-manip assignment, we went through all of the different string functions in php. I used the founding fathers copy pasta, simply becuase that is one of my favorites.

### nestedLoops
_________
For nestedLoops assignment, we made a simple multiplication table and siplayed it in a small window in a web page

### formHandling
______
The formHandling assignment was our mid-term project, and we were tasked with creating a mad lib, where one page prompted the user for input, and then you could hit the button which changed pages, and utilized the form responses.

### file-handling
________
File-handling was a simple assignment where we just learned how to open and close files using php.

### db-queries
________
DB-queries was our first assignment where we actually had to interact with a database. Since this was our first expereience with it, all we had to do was loop through all the results of a given query.

### final-project
________
The final project for this class was actually a lot of fun despite my difficulties with it. The goal of this assignment was to create a media database with multiple tables and numerous entries *thanks chat gpt for making those entries much easier and faster*. We then had to implement the ability to add, edit, or delete entries from the database. I wasn't able to get the project working perfectly, but I am still proud of my work with it, as well as the lessons the process taught me. I got much better at interpretting errors and looking into how to fix said errors.
